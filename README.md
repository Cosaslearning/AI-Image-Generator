This project is a simple AI Image Generator web application that allows users to generate AI images based on a provided text prompt. It leverages the OpenAI API to create images and offers the option to download them. The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Below, we have provided an optimized version of the code with comments to explain each step. 


**HTML File (index.html):**

- The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page for the AI image generator.
- It includes references to an external CSS file (`style.css`) for styling and an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) for functionality.
- The page contains a header with a logo and title, a form for user input, and a section for displaying generated images.


**CSS File (style.css):**

- The CSS file defines styles for various elements on the page, including colors, fonts, layout, and components such as headers, forms, and buttons.

**JavaScript File (script.js):**

- The JavaScript file provides the main functionality of the AI image generator.
- It defines variables to select HTML elements and functions to update image boxes and generate AI images using the OpenAI API.
- Event listeners are set up to handle form submission and user interactions.


This web application provides a user-friendly interface for generating AI images based on user prompts. It leverages the OpenAI API and allows users to select the number and size of images to generate. The generated images are displayed with the option to download them. The code has been optimized and well-commented for clarity and functionality. Feel free to customize it further to meet your specific requirements or integrate it into a larger AI Image Generator project.
